## Hi there, welcome to gptme! ðŸ‘‹

Here we build and develop [gptme], a free and open-source AI assistant that lives in your terminal. It is general-purpose with a wide variety of tools (shell, ipython, browser, computer use), and also an excellent coding agent.

We also build a variety of projects around and on top, like [gptme-agent-template], [gptme-rag], and [wrappers for social media][gptme-contrib] like Discord and Twitter.

Try it out, tell us what you think, and contribute! See the [getting started guide][docs-getting-started] in the [docs] to get started.
